TODO

-- rescrape followers with the ?since= parameter
-- scrape users/show for a contiguous stretch of IDs


-- normalize tup into timestamped columnss


-- twoosh: take most frequent tweet length as fraction of tweets -> histogram

- for each dimension pair X, Y, by %ile find ∂y for that x
  also cut out a sample

-- compare in-link and out-link prestige; also each vs prestige of high-value 1-hood.

Metrics:

* followers/day, ∂(followers) in last (21?) days (see SHAQ for picture of ascent)
* avg, stdev of tweets/day
* influx: Sum[(tweets/day)] for all followed 
* outflux: followers * tweets/day
* friends/followers
* geolocation

2-hood properties
Consider edges (in- and out-) of all members (in- and out-) of a node's 1-hood.

* out-perimeter: unique nodes at distance 2 following two out-edges.
* in-perimeter: similarly

* out-triangles: friends of
  
* loops: triangles with 'flow' (A follows B, B follows C, C follows A).
  shared interest: A follows B and 
 
  triangle categorization
